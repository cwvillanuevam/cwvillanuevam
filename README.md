# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I am a Mechanical Electrical Engineer, Master, and Doctor of Science with a mention on Energy. I have a great passion for modeling, data analysis, and object-oriented programming. I work as a consultant on engineering projects at various stages and also engage in academic research, focusing on modeling, simulation, and optimization of energy models, as well as conducting operation and contingency analysis. I have participated in research projects on the modeling of electric vehicles, distributed generation, and modeling of the electrical grid in general, applying data mining, analysis, and synthesis techniques. I have also been involved in job projects related to modeling the electrical grid, such as pre-operational studies using open access software, analysis of occurrences during power plant shutdowns, feasibility studies for a mining company, regulatory analysis of ancillary services, and development of regulations for pumped hydroelectric power plants in Honduras. My profile is multidisciplinary and flexible, capable of adapting to different areas where my knowledge can be applied. You can find some of my most prominent projects and publications on my GitHub profile. I hope you like them.
